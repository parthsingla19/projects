# 🐦 Tweet Intelligence Engine (T.I.E) 🚀🔥

Welcome to **Tweet Intelligence Engine (T.I.E)** — a cutting-edge ML-powered web app that predicts the *likes* a tweet might get based on its content, context, and metadata, and even generates compelling tweets tailored to your brand and topic.

---

## ⚡ Features

- **Data-driven like prediction:**  
  Uses a robust ensemble model (Stacking Regressor combining RandomForest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression) trained on rich tweet features:

  - Content features: word & char counts, TF-IDF score, sentiment polarity & category (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Metadata features: posting hour, presence of media, hashtags, URLs, emojis
  - Brand context: company encoding & average company likes
- **Smart Tweet Generator:**  
  Generate tweet text dynamically based on brand, tweet type (e.g., announcement, question, tip), and optional topic/message.
- **Interactive UI with modern, elegant theme:**  
  Built using Flask + Jinja2, featuring light/dark mode toggle with smooth animations and a beautiful Playfair Display font styling.
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline:**  
  Cleans input data, encodes categorical variables, extracts advanced features like emoji counts and sentiment analysis (via TextBlob).
- **Model persistence & compression:**  
  Serialized model (`like_predictor.pkl`) is compressed for efficient storage and fast loading.

## 🚀 How It Works - The Pipeline

1. **Data ingestion:**  
   Loads tweet dataset from Google Sheets as CSV.

2. **Data cleansing & feature extraction:**  
   - Drops rows missing critical info
   - Encodes companies and users with `LabelEncoder`
   - Creates new features such as:
     - Sentiment polarity & sentiment category via TextBlob
     - Emoji counts via regex matching Unicode emoji ranges
     - Detects presence of hashtags & URLs
     - Computes TF-IDF mean scores on tweet content
     - Tags if media is attached
     - Extracts posting hour and day of week

3. **Model training:**  
   - Base learners: Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor
   - Final estimator: Linear Regression (for stacking ensemble)
   - Trained on engineered features to predict number of likes
   - Multiple models evaluated with RMSE metric; stacking ensemble yields best results

4. **Model deployment:**  
   Flask web app loads the compressed model, accepts user input from form,  
   generates a tweet (with SimpleTweetGenerator), extracts features from generated tweet,  
   and returns predicted likes along with tweet text.
